	<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
	<p> Hello. My name is MaÃ«l Quentin. I was born in Marseille, France, on January 17, 2002. I have lived in four countries: France, Pakistan, Nigeria, and the United States. The many locations that I have travelled to have given me a lot of knowledge on different cultures, and I am grateful for the many experiences that I have acquired through my life. I am currently a high school freshman at Stuyvesant High School, and I am always looking into ways better myself and the world around me.</p>

		<p> I go to Stuyvesant High School, one of the specialized high schools in New York. I am currently a freshman taking regular classes such as math, biology, and history, as well as more colorful classes such as swimming, art history, and Japanese. In the coming years, however, I am looking to try out classes that I am specifically interested in such as: languages, computer science, and politics.

		<p> I am a gamer. I mostly play on PS4, where I frequent mostly competitive games such as Overwatch and Destiny. Gaming also enables me to keep my French consistent since I almost always play with friends from France. Gaming is a lot of fun, and I hope that my team can come to a point where we can participate in tournaments. </p>

		<p> Cubing is a thing that I really got into during middle school. I already knew how to solve one, but as I got more into it, I started expanding to many more different cubes. I made cubing a big thing in my school. There was a point where almost everywhere I would go, I would see someone trying to sovle a Rubik's cube. I've also been to a couple of competitions, but I didn't have enough experience yet to place very high. </p>
